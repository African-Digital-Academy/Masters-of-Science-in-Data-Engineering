Based on the business requirements, define data archiving strategies that determine which data should be archived and when. Consider factors such as data age, relevance, frequency of access, and compliance requirements. Some common data archiving strategies include:

a. Time-based Archiving: Archive data after a specific period, such as monthly or annually, based on the data's age.

b. Event-based Archiving: Archive data when a specific event or trigger occurs, such as project completion, contract expiration, or regulatory changes.

c. Access Frequency-based Archiving: Archive data that is rarely accessed or has a low priority for day-to-day operations.

d. Compliance-based Archiving: Archive data to ensure compliance with legal or regulatory requirements, such as data retention laws or industry-specific guidelines.

Determine Data Retention Periods:
Establish data retention periods for different types of data based on legal requirements, industry standards, and business needs. Retention periods define how long data should be retained before it is considered eligible for archiving or deletion. Consider factors such as data sensitivity, legal obligations, and potential future use of the data.

Implement Data Archiving Mechanisms:
Implement the necessary mechanisms and technologies to archive data efficiently. This may involve setting up data storage systems, implementing data partitioning or data sharding strategies, and establishing secure backup and recovery processes. Consider leveraging cloud storage solutions for cost-effectiveness and scalability.

Data Lifecycle Management:
Develop a comprehensive data lifecycle management strategy that includes data creation, ingestion, processing, archiving, and eventual deletion. Define clear workflows and processes for managing data throughout its lifecycle, ensuring data integrity, security, and accessibility.

Compliance and Security Considerations:
Ensure that the data archiving and retention policies comply with relevant data protection regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or industry-specific guidelines. Implement appropriate security measures to protect archived data from unauthorized access or data breaches.

Monitoring and Governance:
Establish monitoring mechanisms to track the effectiveness of data archiving and retention policies. Regularly review and audit the processes to ensure compliance and make necessary adjustments as per evolving business requirements or regulatory changes. Document the policies and keep them up to date.

Deliverables:
