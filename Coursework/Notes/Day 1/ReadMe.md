# Masters of Science in Data Engineering
<b>African Digital University, Open Campus</b>

<b> Day 1: Overview of Data Engineering Concepts and Tools</b>

<b>Introduction to Data Engineering</b>
- Provide an overview of data engineering as a discipline and its importance in the field of data science and analytics.
- Discuss the role of data engineers in the data lifecycle and their responsibilities in data acquisition, storage, processing, and delivery.

<b>Data Engineering Lifecycle</b>
- Explain the different phases of the data engineering lifecycle, including data ingestion, data transformation, data storage, data processing, and data delivery.
- Discuss the challenges and considerations at each stage.

<b>Data Engineering Tools and Technologies</b>
- Introduce the various tools and technologies commonly used in data engineering. This can include:
  - Data integration tools: Explain tools like Apache Kafka, Apache Nifi, or AWS Glue, used for ingesting and streaming data from different sources.
  - Data processing frameworks: Discuss popular frameworks like Apache Spark, Apache Flink, or Apache Beam, used for large-scale data processing and analytics.
  - ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools: Cover tools like Apache Airflow, Informatica, or Talend, used for building data pipelines and orchestrating ETL processes.
  - Cloud platforms: Introduce cloud-based platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP, and highlight their relevance in data engineering, including scalability, elasticity, and managed services for data storage and processing.
  - Data storage systems: Discuss various data storage systems such as relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL), NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra), and data warehouses (e.g., Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery).
  - Data visualization and reporting tools: Mention tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Looker, used for visualizing and reporting data to stakeholders.

<b>Data Engineering Best Practices</b>
- Share some best practices followed in the data engineering field, such as data governance, data quality assurance, data security, and performance optimization.

<b>Case Studies</b>
- Provide real-world case studies or examples of successful data engineering projects, highlighting the challenges faced and the solutions implemented.

<b> Q&A and Discussion</b>
- Allocate time for questions and encourage participants to share their thoughts and experiences related to data engineering concepts and tools.

By covering these topics in the Day 1 session, participants will gain a comprehensive understanding of data engineering as a discipline, the tools and technologies used, and the best practices to follow when working with data at scale.
