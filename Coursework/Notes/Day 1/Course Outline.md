Day 1: Overview of Data Engineering Concepts and Tools</p>
Proposed outline</p>

<b>Introduction to Data Engineering: <b></p>
Provide an overview of data engineering as a discipline and its importance in the field of data science and analytics. </p>
Discuss the role of data engineers in the data lifecycle and their responsibilities in data acquisition, storage, processing, and delivery.</p>

<b>Data Engineering Lifecycle: <b>
Explain the different phases of the data engineering lifecycle, including data ingestion, data transformation, data storage, 
data processing, and data delivery. Discuss the challenges and considerations at each stage.</p>

<b>Data Engineering Tools and Technologies: <b></p>
Introduce the various tools and technologies commonly used in data engineering. This can include:</p>

<b>Data integration tools: <b></p>
Explain tools like Apache Kafka, Apache Nifi, or AWS Glue, used for ingesting and streaming data from different sources.</p>

<b>Data processing frameworks: <b></p>
Discuss popular frameworks like Apache Spark, Apache Flink, or Apache Beam, used for large-scale data processing and analytics.</p>

<b>ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools: <b></p>
Cover tools like Apache Airflow, Informatica, or Talend, used for building data pipelines and orchestrating ETL processes.</p>

<b>Cloud platforms: <b></p>
Introduce cloud-based platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP, and highlight their relevance in data engineering, including scalability, elasticity, 
and managed services for data storage and processing.</p>

<b>Data storage systems: <b>
Discuss various data storage systems such as relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL), NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra), 
and data warehouses (e.g., Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery).</p>

<b>Data visualization and reporting tools: </p>
Mention tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Looker, used for visualizing and reporting data to stakeholders.</p>

<b>Data Engineering Best Practices: <b></p>
Share some best practices followed in the data engineering field, such as data governance, data quality assurance, data security,
and performance optimization.</p>

<b>Case Studies: <b></p>
Provide real-world case studies or examples of successful data engineering projects, highlighting the challenges faced and the solutions implemented.</p>

<b>Q&A and Discussion: <b></p>
Allocate time for questions and encourage participants to share their thoughts and experiences related to data engineering concepts and tools.</p>

By covering these topics in the Day 1 session, participants will gain a comprehensive understanding of data engineering as a discipline, the tools and
technologies used, and the best practices to follow when working with data at scale.</p>
